Welcome to the Resident Evil 0 Randomizer, a set of tools designed to spice up your gameplay experience in Resident Evil 0! 
This randomizer is compatible with the **legal Steam version only**. It won't modify your game files or executables.

## Configuration

1. Run the `Configurator` to create a randomizer configuration.
2. I added (very few...) __useful options__, like excluding ink ribbons from randomization.
3. Set your preferences for randomized items â€“ choose from __multiple randomization modes__ to control which random items you prefer.

## Usage

1. Create a configuration and select a working directory.
2. Start the game and also launch the Randomizer itself.
3. Load your config and connect to the game.

Happy randomizing! ðŸŽ®ðŸ§Ÿ

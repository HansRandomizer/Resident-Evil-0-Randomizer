## Configuration

1. Run the `Configurator` to create a randomizer configuration.
2. I added (very few...) __useful options__, like excluding ink ribbons from randomization.
3. Set your preferences for randomized items â€“ choose from __multiple randomization modes__ to control which random items you prefer.

## Known Issues and Features in Development

- The **Balanced mode** is currently too random and doesn't effectively balance gameplay. **FIXED IN 1.0.2**
- The **stack count** doesn't update when an item is randomized (for example, 1 First Aid Kit turns into 1 bullet). **FIXED IN 1.0.2**

  
- Issues with stack cound may arise when two items of the same type are placed in the same a room. **Be careful when dropping and picking up again, until I provide a fix**
  
- In a case where many items are dropped at once, some items were lost. I am addressing this issue. **Don't drop too many items at once, until I provide a fix**


## Soft Lock Warnings and Crashes
- User NeoSyther figured out, that you should not use the lift after you unlocked the kitchen with the "Fire Key". Fixes and workarounds are under dicussion. For more infos see Issue 3.

## AntiVir False Positives
This randomizer is based on the popular open source development software Cheat Engine, which can trigger false positive anti virus alerts.

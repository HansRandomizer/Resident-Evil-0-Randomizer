## Configuration

1. Run the `Configurator` to create a randomizer configuration.
2. I added (very few...) __useful options__, like excluding ink ribbons from randomization.
3. Set your preferences for randomized items â€“ choose from __multiple randomization modes__ to control which random items you prefer.

## Usage

1. Create a configuration and select a working directory.
2. Start the game and also launch the Randomizer itself.
3. Load your config and connect to the game.
4. Now, just start or continue your randomized game and enjoy the new twists!

Happy randomizing! ðŸŽ®ðŸ§Ÿ

## Please Report Crashes
Help me to make this randomizer more stable. Report crashes and send me the init.json files with a copy of your randomizer log that appears for every run when you start randomizing. 


## Known Issues

- The **Balanced mode** was **FIXED IN 1.0.2**
- The **stack count** issue was **FIXED IN 1.0.2**

- Issues with stack cound may arise when two items of the same type are placed in the same room. **Be careful when dropping and picking up again, until I provide a fix**
- In a case where many items are dropped at once, some items were lost. I am addressing this issue. **Don't drop too many items at once, until I provide a fix**
- Other modes than Balanced Mode need improvement. **I recommend using balanced mode for maximum fun.**

# Development and Upcoming Features
- Enemy randomization (in progress)
- Improving modes (backlog)
- Adding more options to the Configurator (backlog)
- Enhancing item drop mechanism (backlog)

## Soft Lock Warnings and Crashes
- User NeoSyther figured out, that you should not use the lift after you unlocked the kitchen with the "Fire Key". Fixes and workarounds are under dicussion. For more infos see Issue #3.

## AntiVir False Positives
This randomizer is based on the popular open source development software Cheat Engine, which can trigger false positive anti virus alerts.
